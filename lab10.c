DMART is providing special offer to its customer on New Yearâ€™s Eve. Customers 
can buy anything they want with flat80% discount, but the products they buy 
should fit into the basket provided by DMART. The objective is to collect the 
expensive products which fit into the given basket and overall weight of the 
basket cannot exceed 15kg.Write an algorithm by using knapsack algorithm 
using dynamic programming to find the best subset for the given scenario.
